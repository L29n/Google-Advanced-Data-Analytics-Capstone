Activity_ Course 7 Salifort Motors project lab.ipynb is a jupyter notebook containing a variety of visualizations and my approach to the problem (predicting employee churn) with a logistic regression model, random forest model (with hyperparameter tuning), and an XGBoost model (also with hyperparemter tuning). The XGBoost model achieved the best results with a 98% accuracy rate and 95% f1 score. The model results also include their respective classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC Curve
